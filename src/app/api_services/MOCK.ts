We ain’t shooting til we test these and we ain’t stopping til we catch 3. Hit his crib and tell him catch me. They like they ain’t playing fair yeah this shit that deep. \nThe other day I almost clapped a Nigga. Whole time this just a fan he trying to snap a picture.\n\nThat get back gone be so real we gotta wrap a Nigga. We just riding lurking tryna catch a rapper Nigga and if we ever said it’s up nigga. Then it’s stuck nigga. I’m the type to come through dressed up like a cluck Nigga. Now you boxed up in that corner and you fucked nigga. And the last words that you heard was this for Duck nigga. And all that fake shit don’t come around with it. Cause usually that snake shit come around with it. And usually the ones that fold say they down with it. You hanging with that Nigga he told you must be down with it. And ain’ t gotta get close to you. Nigga I can get you touched from a ocean view. I just make a call and they do what they post to do. Aint no capping boa them scrappers they stand over you. Like Dooski say I got a bond with my shooters.\n\nAnd if they catch a case then we just bond out the shooter. We might hit yo crib like we running with the looters. You can try to run but ain’t no running from this Ruger. I catch the killer he getting buried alive no buried in five. When my niggas want you where you gone hide better ride with that fire.\n\nAnd if we can’t find you we gone get somebody that mean a lot to you. So you can keep on hiding and we Gon end up taking a lot from you. And ain’t no question I don’t wanna talk. Ain’t no drive-by shootings today I wanna walk.\n\n- We been at his crib some hours today I wanna stalk. And we ain’t leaving from his crib until this nigga caught. He coming out I saw him in HD. Ran up on him with the pipe.\n\n Like nigga take these. Nigga stumbling and running he can’t shake these. Then all you seen was a flash. Told him say cheese. Look got a lot of shit on my mind I just keep inside. Because if I let it out you might jus see them demons fly. It’s fucked up when you lose your Nigga and see him die. That hit a part in yo soul where you can’t even cry. I then witness Niggas change right in front of me. And I then witnessed Niggas get changed right in front of me. Mama always ask me son what you wanna be. But it ain’t what I wanna be ma it’s what I’m gonna be. I always been the humble type but never been the mumble type. Was raised around them young wild Niggas in that jungle life. You wouldn’t last a day you don’t wanna see what that jungle like. Them youngings riding around with pipes them youngings they’ll take your life. Most of my niggas gang bang or locked up in a cell. Sometimes I ask the man upstairs is we living in hell. Them shorties run up on your porch like they deliver mail. Them shorties run up with that torch and just deliver shells. See I grew up in a city full of hatred. Where they see you got a way out but don’t wanna see you make it. They don’t wanna see you take it. They dont wanna see you chase it. \n\nThey gone smile like its love but deep down inside they hate it. See I came along way from depression and aggression. From welfare to section 8 I thank God cause it’s a blessing. Brothers in and out of jail’s lord knows my mama stressing. Thinking about the life I live like will I make it to see heaven.\n\nWill I make it to see 27 I’ll be damned I be under a reveren. I’ll be damned I  let a Nigga get up on me he gone catch six from the seven. I then seen Niggas hang with Niggas who then told. So I don’t fuck with them you fuck with him you then told. I can vouch these niggas bitches on bro nem. And I can merch that on them Niggas on folk nem. If that was me won’t be no witness naww.\n\nIf that was me won’t be no sentence. Look So run up on me wrong you better have your shit together. Because them killers I fuck with they be with whatever. My niggas hopping out with them deserts. We ain’t come to Send a blessing boa we came to send a message. \n\nLook moral of the story keep a weapon if he trying to learn. He get burned because I teach a lesson. Hollows open up like presents when I shoot that Smith and Wesson. For some shit he did in the past now he ain’t present Nigga.",

It's crazy\nI wish the storm would just blow this motherfucker away\nWhy you say that?\nSerious, man, I hate this fuckin' town\nYou know Bobby needs you at the job, right?\nMan, fuck him\nFuck Bobby? I thought you liked Bobby\nI'm gettin' the fuck out of here, man\nOkay\nWatch\n\n[Verse 1]\nYeah, Tommy just got out of jail (Got out of jail? Got out of jail)\nTwo months he couldn't make bail (Couldn't make bail? Couldn't make bail)\nHere we sit, whiskey bent, freestylin' over cricket chirps\nHe would spit, then I went, loaded gun, death we flirt\nLeave it up to the Baptist church, me and him are scum of the Earth\nFeelin' like two millionaires with a hundred dollar net worth\nTopic of discussion is that they know nothin'\nThey didn't find the other twenty pounds hid in the oven\nWhat happened to me and you? We used to go to Sunday School\nAnd we worked Monday 'til Friday, and sometimes Sunday, too\nFive-hundred dollar check and that's no disrespect\nBut I'm a talent, God damn it, you watch, I'm tellin' you\nWe had it all mapped out, hip-hop 'til we crashed out\nI drank 'til I couldn't walk straight, on the front porch where we passed out\nNothin' but trouble, dealin' with troubles over our sorrow\nAnd the clouds followed, we was just like\n\n[Chorus]\nJust like lightning in a bottle\nBurnin' electric blue\nJust like gunshots in the hollow\nEchoin' all night through\nThis is how we shed our problems\nUnder the southern moon\nJust like lightning in a bottle\nBurnin' electric blue (Yeah)\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's three o'clock in the morning, I got two packs of Parliament Lights and\nA dime bag of that 'Bama brick, I just lay in the dark of the night on\nThe bed of my buddy's truck who got it from his papa back when\nHe died in a fire rescue and I never asked what happened\nWe listened to Charlie Daniels, Too $hort and Bob Seger\nSing along to \"Night Moves\", sippin' on gas station margaritas\nGotta get a good buzz out here, man, nothin' else to do but get high\nPut bullet holes in beer cans and talk about how we gonna get by\nSome say that dreaming's useless, full of pride and selfishness\nEscapin' that mental prison's like climbin' the electric fence\nAnd that's a risk, but a risk I'll take to better with\n'Cause through Hell I've been, so success would be just self-defense\nI took another swallow, can't share my dream with everybody\nAnd besides, to the factory, I clock in tomorrow\nAnd to my room, I wobble, but the vision I follow\nA storm was brewin', we was just like\n\n[Chorus]\nJust like lightning in a bottle\nBurnin' electric blue\nJust like gunshots in the hollow\nEchoin' all night through\nThis is how we shed our problems\nUnder the southern moon\nJust like lightning in a bottle\nBurnin' electric blue\nJust like lightning in a bottle\nBurnin' electric blue\nJust like gunshots in the hollow\nEchoin' all night through\nThis is how we shed our problems\nUnder the southern moon\nJust like lightning in a bottle\nBurnin' electric blue\n\n[Outro]\nLightning in a bottle\nBurnin' electric blue\nLightning in a bottle\nBurnin' electric blue\nLightning in a bottle\nBurnin' electric blue\n\n\n\n#Yelawolf #Lightning #GhettoCowboy",

        "description": "This time we want to show you how a impostor rejects to continue this way, and wants to help the crew, but at a certain moments the other members notice is a impostor, if he is good now, how can resolve this situation?\nThanks you so much for support me! \nI love you! ❤️\n\nOriginal Animation by Hornstromp.\n\nAmong Us is an American made science fiction based murder mystery video game developed and published by Innersloth. Inc. It was released for IOS and Android on June 15, 2018, for PC on Steam on August 18, 2018 and for Dajolg on November 2, 2018. Among Us follows a crew being picked off one by one by an impostor.\n\nIn each game the player is one of 4 to 10 living and working in several different environments. One of these crewmates is an Impostor whose main goal is to kill everyone else. The remainder of the players are part of the regular crew who are just trying to escape unharmed. To do this, they have to complete several tasks or (better yet) find the Impostor and vote them out Survivor-style. If they are successful, the Crew wins. If the Impostor manages to kill them all, the player is victorious. In a 10 player game with one Impostor, there is a 10% chance of being an Impostor.\n\nThe free map, Skeld, has 14 different rooms that are connected by 7 hallways. Everyone begins the game in the Cafeteria and, depending on the host's settings, as well as on RNG, Crew members have to visit some or most of the other rooms to complete their tasks.\n\nWhile Impostors do not have tasks as their specific objectives, they can fake “completing” certain activities as a way to gain everyone else's trust. Every user has a chance to call an emergency meeting or, upon seeing a dead body, to report it to everyone else. For the mobile release, discussions are only possible during these time-limited events.\n\nIf you are an Impostor, your main goal is to convince others that you are not the Impostor, while the Crew's job is to spot you out. Since it is a voting system where the person with the most votes gets eliminated from the game, it does not really matter who does what. Instead, your argumentative powers are what makes a difference. To sway people in one direction or another, you have to be prepared to make your case as convincing as possible. There is a short time-limit, so you either have to present very strong evidence or come up with a believable narrative that will take others off your trail.\n\nWhen you are killed by the Impostor, you become a ghost. Although you cannot interact or discuss with others, you can help them complete tasks.\n\nStreamers complained about chat being main form of communications, so a lot of streamers used discord for voice chat.\n\n#AmongUs #AmongUsMeme\n#AmongUsAnimation",

        "description": "We lost one of the most influential and innovative guitarist of the Rock Era, when Eddie Van Halen succumbed to his long battle with throat cancer.   He was only 65 years old.  the word Legend is thrown around too much in the world we live in now. The over use of the term waters down the meaning for true legends and make no mistake the word legend was coined for EVH. Here at Professor of Rock, we want to honor to the Legend Eddie Van Halen through the music.   Not only was Eddie one of the all-time greatest guitarists, he was also a master composer, lyricist, producer, and multi-instrumentalist. He was a lightning fast player, a relentless originator, and a veritable trailblazer.  Here we break down Eddie’s top 5 song from both David Lee Roth era and the Sammy Hagar era including Runnin’ with the Devil, Dreams, 5150, Panama, Best of Both Worlds, Mean Streets, I’m the One, Jump, When It’s Love, Poundcake and more with commentary by Sammy Hagar. \n\nThank you to this Episodes Sponsor, Zenni Optical\nIncredible Prices on New Glasses - https://bit.ly/ZenniOpticalShop\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProfessor's Store\nCheck out my Hand Picked Selection Below\n- Eddie Van Halen T Shirt https://amzn.to/2FiqATI\n- Must Have Van Halen Vinyl https://amzn.to/2IhC62W\n- 100 Best Selling Albums https://amzn.to/3h3qZX9\n- Ultimate History of 80s Teen Movie https://amzn.to/3ifjdKQ\n- 80s to 90s VHS Video Cover Art https://amzn.to/2QXzmIX\n- Totally Awesome 80s A Lexicon https://amzn.to/3h4ilrk\n- Best In Ear Headphones (I Use These Every Day) https://amzn.to/2ZcTlIl\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHonorary Producers\nGreg Arends, Howard Herrick\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCheck Out The Professor of Rock Merch Store - http://bit.ly/ProfessorMerch\n\nAccess To Backstage Content\nBecome a Patron - http://bit.ly/ProfessorofRockVIPFan\n\nHelp out the Channel by purchasing your albums through our links!
